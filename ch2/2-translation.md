"Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid." "I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives." "I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing," the old man said. "They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand." "The great Sisler's father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age."

你记得他以前常常来露台吗，我想带她去打鱼，但我太害羞了，不敢去问他，我让你去问他，结果你也害羞了 ，我知道，那是个大错误，他可能会和我们一起去呢，那可够我们乐一辈子的，我想要（张：很想；余：真想）带伟大的迪马乔去打鱼，老人说，他们说它的父亲是个渔夫，可能（张：也许，余：恐怕）他（以前）像我们一样穷，这样他就能理解我们（余：懂得这一套的）。伟大的西斯勒的父亲从没有穷过，他在我这个年纪的时候就已经在大联赛里打棒球（余和张都翻译成球）了。
**【比对&反馈】**
张:我很想带伟大的狄玛奇奥去打鱼。张爱玲的‘很想’和前文的“想要”相比有递进的味道。
前文提及过的可在后面适当简略。如打棒球翻译成球
**【困惑&难点】**
Then we would have that for all of our lives.不会翻译，参考了其他版本翻译。

"When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening." "I know. You told me." "Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?" "Baseball I think," the boy said. "Tell me about the great John J. McGraw." He said Jota for J. "He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as baseball.
我在你这个年纪的时候，在一条专跑非洲的方形船上做水手，在傍晚，我能看见岸上的狮子，我知道，你对我讲过了。我们~~是在~~谈棒球还是~~在~~谈非洲？我想应该是棒球吧，男孩说，跟我谈谈伟大的约翰麦格劳吧，他把杰说成了杰塔。以前他~~常~~（有时也）来露台，可是他喝醉了之后很凶，说话声音很大，脾气也很差。~~他的脑子里只有棒球和马~~（他心心念念除了棒球还有赛马）。
**【比对&反馈】**
余光中把傍晚翻译成黄昏，结合张爱玲的翻译成：到黄昏我还在海岸上看见过狮子，更口语化也有意境
段落的划分导致理解改变。如他心心念念除了棒球还有赛马，需要对应下文才好理解
**【困惑&难点】**
But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult
英文基础差，对句子结构不清晰，单词只知道部分意思

At least he carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone." "He was a great manager," the boy said. "My father thinks he was the greatest." "Because he came here the most times," the old man said. "If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager." "Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?" "I think they are equal. "And the best fisherman is you." " No. I know others better."
至少他~~每次来的时候~~（是一天到晚）口袋里都装着马的名单，~~每次都大声地~~（并且常常）在电话里说马的名字。他是个了不起的经理人，男孩说，我父亲认为他是最~~好的~~伟大的一个，因为他最常来这儿，如果德罗期每年都来这儿，你父亲也会认为他是最好的经理人。谁是最好的经理人来着？卢克还是麦克?我觉得他们都一样。但是你是最好的渔夫，不，我知道更好的。
"Que va," the boy said. "There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you." "Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong. "There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say," "I may not be as strong as I think," the old man said. "But I know many tricks and I have resolution." "You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the Terrace."
哪里的话？男孩说，好的渔夫有很多，（伟大的也有几个），但最伟大的渔夫只有你一个。谢谢，~~你真让我开心~~（听你这样说我真快乐）。我希望不会有（太大的）鱼来戳穿我们的大话。~~如果你像你说的那么强壮，就不会有那样的鱼。~~（没有这样的鱼，只要你仍旧那么强健，像你说的那样。）。我可能（也许）没有我想的那么强壮，老人说，但是我知道很多技巧，我还有信心。你现在应该去睡觉了，早上才能有精神，我把东西拿回露台去。

"Good night then. I will wake you in the morning." "You're my alarm clock." the boy said. "Age is my alarm clock," the old man said. "Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?" "I don't know, the boy said. All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard." "I can remember it," the old man said. "I'll waken you in time." "I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior." "I know." "Sleep well old man.

（那么）晚安，~~我早上会把你叫醒~~（张：我早上来叫醒你）。你是我的闹钟，男孩说，这把年纪是我的闹钟，老人说。为什么老人~~都起~~（醒的）这么早?是不是这样日子更长些？我不知道，男孩说，我只知道年轻的男孩睡得晚，睡得也沉。我会记得的，老人说，~~我会准时把你叫醒~~我到时会把你叫醒，我不喜欢他叫醒我，那样显得我比他低一级。我知道，睡个好觉，老头子

The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old an took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed. He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains.
男孩出去了，~~他们在没有灯的桌子上吃饭~~（张：他们刚才吃饭，桌上并没有灯），老人脱掉它的长裤，在黑暗中爬上了床，它把长裤卷了卷，在里面垫了些报纸当枕头，~~他把自己裹在毯子里~~（他用毯子裹住自己），~~在床上没有报纸覆盖的地方睡着了~~（余：睡在铺着旧报纸的弹簧床上。）。~~他睡的时间很短~~（张：他很快就睡熟了），~~他梦到了在她还是个男孩的时候看见的非洲~~（梦见在少年时去过的非洲），~~金黄和白色相间的沙滩，白色是那样白，刺伤了他的眼睛~~（梦见漫长的金色海岸和白得刺眼的海岸），还有~~那高高的胛和棕色的山~~（高耸的海岬，褐色的大山）
**【比对&反馈】**
余光中翻译的更为精简，在翻译一些绕圈子的句子时有优势。如梦见漫长的金色海岸和白得刺眼的海岸。
**【困惑&难点】**

He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning. Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbors and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.
他现在每晚都~~睡~~(住)在海岸~~旁~~边，在梦里，他能听见海浪的~~声音~~(张：吼声)，也能看见本地船只穿过这片海岸，他能闻到甲板上焦油和橡木的味道，然后他闻到每天早晨从非洲吹来的微风的味道。每当老人闻到这微风的味道的时候，他都会爬起来，穿好衣服，去叫醒男孩，但是今晚的微风来的特别早，老人知道它在梦中是来的太早了，于是接着梦到了陆地上耸起的白色山峰，梦到了加那利群岛不同的港湾和路基。

He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy.
他不再梦见暴风雨，女人，大事，大鱼，打架，掰手腕和他的妻子。他现在只能梦见岸上成群结队的狮子，他们想年轻的小猫那样在黄昏下玩耍，他爱他们，就像他爱那男孩。她从没有梦见过男孩。老人醒了，从敞开的门里望出去是一轮月亮。他摊平它的长裤，把它穿在身上，走到棚屋外小便，然后他走上马路去叫醒孩子了。

He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be . The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.
他在早晨的寒冷中瑟瑟发抖。但是老人知道颤抖能让自己变暖，那不需要太久。男孩住的棚屋的门关着，老人打开门，用赤裸的脚轻轻的走进去。男孩睡在第一个房间的窄床上，老人借助快要消失的月光能清楚的看见男孩的脸，他轻轻抓住男孩的一只脚，男孩醒了，转过身看着老人，老人冲他点点头，男孩从床边的椅子上拿起裤子，坐在床上穿起来。

The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, "I am sorry." "Que'va," the boy said. "It is what a man must do." They walked down the road to the old man's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats. When they reached the old man's shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.
老人走出门,男孩打着哈切跟在老人后面，老人把手臂搭在男孩肩膀上说，我很抱歉，不要这么说，男孩说，这是我应该做的，他们走上通往老人棚屋的马路，整条路都黑漆漆的，赤脚的人带着他们渔船上的桅杆走在马路上。他们到达老人棚屋的时候，男孩拿起篮子里的鱼线，渔叉与鱼钩，老人依旧扛着那块卷着帆布的桅杆。

"Do you want coffee?" the boy asked. "We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some." They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen. "How did you sleep old man?" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep. "Very well, Manolin," the old man said. "I feel confident today." "So do I," the boy said. "Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fish baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."
你想要点咖啡吗？男孩问，我们把这些东西放到船里后去喝点吧。They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen.，你怎么睡觉的，老头子？男孩问，虽然他已经起来了，但是依然觉得早起他对来说很困难。很好，玛洛琳，老人说，我今天很有自信。我也是男孩说，现在我要去取你和我的沙丁鱼了，还有你的鱼饵。老人自己把渔具带来了，他从没想过要任何人帮忙。
"We're different," the old man said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old." "I know it," the boy said. "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here." He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.
我们不一样，老人说，你五岁的时候我就让你帮我拿东西了，我知道，男孩说。我马上回来，带点咖啡，我们在这儿还是有点信用的，他走开了，光秃秃的脚踩在珊瑚礁上，朝着冰屋的方向走去，那里放着鱼饵。老人慢慢地喝着咖啡，他这一天就吃这点东西了。老人知道自己应该吃掉它，在很长一段时间里，吃饭困扰着老人，他从不带午饭，但他的船头总有一瓶水，他知道那是他一整天需要的。
The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water. "Good luck old man." "Good luck," the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbor in the dark.
男孩现在带着沙丁鱼和两条鱼饵回来了，鱼饵用报纸包着。他们沿着小径走向小船，祝你好运，老人说，他把桨上的绳索绑在（thole pins）桨架上，他身子向前一仰，把桨叶插到水里一划拉，就在夜色中划出了海湾

There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills. Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbor and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.

还有一些其他的船只从岸上出发，虽然老人看不见他们，但老人能听到他们的桨叶撞击水花的声音，现在月亮渐渐跑到山下去了. 有时候一些人会在船上说话，但是多数船除了木浆打起水花的声音都很沉默，他们一出海湾口就散开了，每个人都向着自己认为能找到鱼群的方向驶着。老人知道自己要去更远的地方，他把陆地的气息远远的甩在后面，把小船驶入清晨的海洋气息之中。

He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the flour of the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and baitfish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.
老人划了一会儿之后，他看见墨西哥湾海草在水中闪烁的粼光，这里的渔夫称这个地方为大井，因为这个地方突然深至七百寻，由于洋流撞在陡峭的悬崖上形成了漩涡，各种鱼类都在这里聚集。有虾米和饵料鱼，海洋最深处的洞里还有成群结队的乌贼，到了晚上，他们升上来，就被游过的鱼类吃掉了。

In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones.
在黑暗中，老人能感觉到快要日出了，他划船的时候听到飞鱼离开水面翅膀震动的声音，在黑暗中，飞鱼僵硬的翅膀在飞翔时发出嘶嘶声。老人喜欢飞鱼，他们是他在大海上唯一的朋友，他为那些鸟感到悲哀，尤其是那些娇小的，黝黑的海燕。他们总是飞来飞去地找食，但没有几次找到过食物，老人想，这些鸟儿可比我们悲惨多了，除了贼鸥和更强壮一些的鸟
Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea. He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say had things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman.
为什么他们把鸟造的像海燕一样又温和又较小呢？尤其是大海还这么残酷的时候？她那么和蔼而美丽。但他也有残忍的时候，那个时候来的太突然了。那些鸟飞着，俯冲下来捕食猎物，他们那小且悲伤的嗓子对大海来说太微不足道了。他总把大海想成拉姆，那是当西班牙人爱他时给他起的名字。有时候这些爱他的人会谈论它，但是他们依然会说，即便他是个女人，他们依然会说。



Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favors, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.
一些年轻的渔夫会用浮标做掉丝的浮子，他们还有摩托艇。那是他们用卖掉的鲨鱼内脏换来的，他们称他为男性的艾玛。他们把大海看作是竞争者，一处领地甚至是敌人。可是老人总是把他看作是一位女性，总是给予或者保留着巨大的恩惠。即便它做了一些狂野乃至奇怪的事情，也是因为他不能帮助他们，这轮月亮影响了他作为一位女性。老人想

He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current. He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour. I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I'll work out where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them. Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current.
他把船划的很稳健，自从他稳定了速度之后，这对老人来说轻而易举，况且海面风平浪静，除了洋流偶尔会形成一些小漩涡。他让洋流替他做了一部分工作，天空开始出现光亮的时候，在这个时间，他发现自己远比预期划的远，我在大井打了好几天鱼，一条鱼也没有找到，他想，今天我会找到鲣鱼和金枪鱼群的，可能还会有一条大鱼跟着他们。在天空完全变亮以前，他会把鱼饵抛下去，让它顺着洋流漂流。
