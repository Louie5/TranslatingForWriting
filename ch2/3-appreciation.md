## Part 6

"Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid." "I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives." "I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing," the old man said. "They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand." "The great Sisler's father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age."

你记得他以前常常来露台吗，我想带她去打鱼，但我太害羞了，不敢去问他，我让你去问他，结果你也害羞了 ，我知道，那是个大错误，他可能会和我们一起去呢，那可够我们乐一辈子的，我想要（张：很想；余：真想）带伟大的迪马乔去打鱼，老人说，他们说它的父亲是个渔夫，可能（张：也许，余：恐怕）他（以前）像我们一样穷，这样他就能理解我们（余：懂得这一套的）。伟大的西斯勒的父亲从没有穷过，他在我这个年纪的时候就已经在大联赛里打棒球（余和张都翻译成球）了。

**【比对&反馈】**
张:我很想带伟大的狄玛奇奥去打鱼。张爱玲的‘很想’和前文的“想要”相比有递进的味道。
前文提及过的可在后面适当简略。如打棒球翻译成球

**【困惑&难点】**
Then we would have that for all of our lives.不会翻译，参考了其他版本翻译。

"When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening." "I know. You told me." "Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?" "Baseball I think," the boy said. "Tell me about the great John J. McGraw." He said Jota for J. "He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as baseball.
我在你这个年纪的时候，在一条专跑非洲的方形船上做水手，在傍晚，我能看见岸上的狮子，我知道，你对我讲过了。我们~~是在~~谈棒球还是~~在~~谈非洲？我想应该是棒球吧，男孩说，跟我谈谈伟大的约翰麦格劳吧，他把杰说成了杰塔。以前他~~常~~（有时也）来露台，可是他喝醉了之后很凶，说话声音很大，脾气也很差。~~他的脑子里只有棒球和马~~（他心心念念除了棒球还有赛马）。

**【比对&反馈】**
余光中把傍晚翻译成黄昏，结合张爱玲的翻译成：到黄昏我还在海岸上看见过狮子，更口语化也有意境
段落的划分导致理解改变。如他心心念念除了棒球还有赛马，需要对应下文才好理解

**【困惑&难点】**
But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult
英文基础差，对句子结构不清晰，单词只知道部分意思

At least he carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone." "He was a great manager," the boy said. "My father thinks he was the greatest." "Because he came here the most times," the old man said. "If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager." "Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?" "I think they are equal. "And the best fisherman is you." " No. I know others better."

至少他~~每次来的时候~~（是一天到晚）口袋里都装着马的名单，~~每次都大声地~~（并且常常）在电话里说马的名字。他是个了不起的经理人，男孩说，我父亲认为他是最~~好的~~伟大的一个，因为他最常来这儿，如果德罗期每年都来这儿，你父亲也会认为他是最好的经理人。谁是最好的经理人来着？卢克还是麦克?我觉得他们都一样。但是你是最好的渔夫，不，我知道更好的。

"Que va," the boy said. "There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you." "Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong. "There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say," "I may not be as strong as I think," the old man said. "But I know many tricks and I have resolution." "You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the Terrace."

哪里的话？男孩说，好的渔夫有很多，（伟大的也有几个），但最伟大的渔夫只有你一个。谢谢，~~你真让我开心~~（听你这样说我真快乐）。我希望不会有（太大的）鱼来戳穿我们的大话。~~如果你像你说的那么强壮，就不会有那样的鱼。~~（没有这样的鱼，只要你仍旧那么强健，像你说的那样。）。我可能（也许）没有我想的那么强壮，老人说，但是我知道很多技巧，我还有信心。你现在应该去睡觉了，早上才能有精神，我把东西拿回露台去。

"Good night then. I will wake you in the morning." "You're my alarm clock." the boy said. "Age is my alarm clock," the old man said. "Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?" "I don't know, the boy said. All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard." "I can remember it," the old man said. "I'll waken you in time." "I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior." "I know." "Sleep well old man.

（那么）晚安，~~我早上会把你叫醒~~（张：我早上来叫醒你）。你是我的闹钟，男孩说，这把年纪是我的闹钟，老人说。为什么老人~~都起~~（醒的）这么早?是不是这样日子更长些？我不知道，男孩说，我只知道年轻的男孩睡得晚，睡得也沉。我会记得的，老人说，~~我会准时把你叫醒~~我到时会把你叫醒，我不喜欢他叫醒我，那样显得我比他低一级。我知道，睡个好觉，老头子----------

The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old an took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed. He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains.
男孩出去了，~~他们在没有灯的桌子上吃饭~~（张：他们刚才吃饭，桌上并没有灯），老人脱掉它的长裤，在黑暗中爬上了床，它把长裤卷了卷，在里面垫了些报纸当枕头，~~他把自己裹在毯子里~~（他用毯子裹住自己），~~在床上没有报纸覆盖的地方睡着了~~（余：睡在铺着旧报纸的弹簧床上。）。~~他睡的时间很短~~（张：他很快就睡熟了），~~他梦到了在她还是个男孩的时候看见的非洲~~（梦见在少年时去过的非洲），~~金黄和白色相间的沙滩，白色是那样白，刺伤了他的眼睛~~（梦见漫长的金色海岸和白得刺眼的海岸），还有~~那高高的胛和棕色的山~~（高耸的海岬，褐色的大山）

**【比对&反馈】**
余光中翻译的更为精简。如梦见漫长的金色海岸和白得刺眼的海岸。

He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning. Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbors and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.

他现在每晚都~~睡~~(住)在海岸~~旁~~边，在梦里，他能听见海浪的~~声音~~(张：吼声)，、

也能看见本地船只穿过这片海岸（张：看见土人的小船破浪而来），他能闻到甲板上焦油和橡木的味道（张：他睡梦中嗅到甲板上焦油和碎绳的气味），然后他闻（嗅）到每天早晨从非洲吹来的微风的味道（张：他也嗅到非洲的气味，早晨陆地上吹来的风带来的。）。

**【反馈】**
1.张和余都将本地船只译作土人的船或舟，破浪而来对比我的穿过这片海岸更具体。
2.翻译的时候把睡梦中落掉了，嗅比闻更低频，更高级。
3.微风是没有味道的，非洲是有味道的，老人嗅到的是非洲而非微风，张译的好。另，如果是我译可能会在早晨陆地前加上那是，不然总感觉语句怪怪的。。。。（？）

每当老人闻到这微风的味道的时候，他都会爬起来（张：他通常都是一嗅到陆地上吹来的风就醒了），穿好衣服，（张：就）去叫醒男孩，但是今晚的微风来的特别早，老人知道它在梦中是来的太早了，于是接着梦到了陆地上耸起的白色山峰，梦到了加那利群岛不同的港湾和路基（张：他在梦里也知道是太早，就继续做梦，看见群岛的白色尖顶从海中突出来，然后他梦见加那利群岛的各个海口和碇泊所）。

**【反馈】**
1.“每当老人闻到这微风的味道的时候”张爱玲翻译此句结构紧凑，我的稍显冗余，还用了两个的。
2.有紧凑的先后关系时，可以使用“就”代替“，”进行连接
3.老人在做梦是不可能知道的，因此只能是梦里知道。
4.山峰明明在原文中是从海边突出来的，我却翻译成从陆地上耸起，太过大意。
5.把different翻译成“各个”明显要比“不同”具象。

He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy.

他不再梦见暴风雨，女人，大事，大鱼，打架，掰手腕和他的妻子（张：他现在不再梦见风暴了，也不梦见女人，也不梦见什么大事，或是大鱼，或是打架，或是角力，也不梦见他的妻。）。他现在只能梦见岸上成群结队的狮子（张：他现在只梦见各种地方，还有海滩上的狮子。），他们想年轻的小猫那样在黄昏下玩耍，他爱他们，就像他爱那男孩。她从没有梦见过男孩。老人醒了（张：他就这么醒过来了），从敞开的门里望出去是一轮月亮（张：门开着，他向门外望了望月亮）。他摊平它的长裤，把它穿在身上，走到棚屋外小便，然后他走上马路去叫醒孩子了。（张：把卷着的袴子摊开来，穿上去。他在小屋外面溺了泡尿，然后沿着路走上去叫醒那孩子。）

**【反馈】**
1.不梦见这里翻译的很精彩，可以看见张爱玲分成了四个部分，整齐且简单。
2.He simply woke我翻译的别扭，张爱玲翻译的很好
3.把小便翻译成溺了泡尿，低频词
4.之前对裤子已经有过卷曲的铺垫了，虽然原文这里没有卷曲，但是也能翻译成卷曲的裤子

He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing. The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.

他在清晨的寒冷中瑟瑟发抖（张：他在清晨的寒冷中颤抖着）。但是老人知道颤抖能让自己变暖（张：但是他知道抖一会就会暖和的），那不需要太久（张：而且他不久就要划船了。 ）。男孩住的棚屋的门没关，老人打开门，用赤裸的脚轻轻的走进去（孩子住的房子，门没有上闩，他开了门，静静地走进去，赤着脚）。男孩睡在第一个房间的窄床上，老人借助快要消失的月光能清楚的看见男孩的脸（张：月亮就要落下去了，月光照进来，老人可以很清楚看见他。），他轻轻抓住男孩的一只脚，男孩醒了，转过身看着老人，老人冲他点点头，男孩从床边的椅子上拿起裤子，坐在床上穿起来。（张：他温柔地握住一只脚，一直握着它，直到那孩子醒过来，翻过身来向他望着。老人点点头，孩子就从床旁边一张椅子上把他的长袴拿下来，坐在床上把袴子套上去。）

**【反馈】**

1.不需要太久这里没有结合上下文，没翻译到位
2.张爱玲的翻译能有一个柔和的铺垫
3.（月亮就要落下去了，月光照进来，老人可以很清楚看见他。）这里的翻译和英文差异较大，但是很优美，有意境。

The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, "I am sorry." "Que'va," the boy said. "It is what a man must do." They walked down the road to the old man's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats. When they reached the old man's shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.
老人走出门,男孩打着哈切跟在老人后面（张：孩子跟着他出来了。他还瞌睡），老人把手臂搭（张：搁）在男孩肩膀上说，我很抱歉，不要这么说，男孩说，这是我应该做的，他们走上通往老人棚屋的马路，整条路都黑漆漆的，赤脚的人带着他们渔船上的桅杆走在马路上（他们顺着路往下走，到老人的小屋去；一路上，在黑暗中，有许多赤着脚的人在那里移动，扛着他们船上的桅杆。）。他们到达老人棚屋的时候，男孩拿起篮子里的鱼线，渔叉与鱼钩，老人依旧扛着那块卷着帆布的桅杆。

**【反馈】**

1.低频：用手搁在肩膀上

2.（他们顺着路往下走，到老人的小屋去；一路上，在黑暗中，有许多赤着脚的人在那里移动，扛着他们船上的桅杆。）张爱玲喜欢把要点分开，不仅容易理解，也更有文气。


## [](https://github.com/Louie5/TranslatingForWriting/blob/master/ch2/1-source-text.md#part-8)Part 8

"Do you want coffee?" the boy asked. "We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some." They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen. "How did you sleep old man?" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep. "Very well, Manolin," the old man said. "I feel confident today." "So do I," the boy said. "Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fish baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."

你想要点咖啡吗？男孩问，我们把这些东西放到船里后去喝点吧（张：我们把工具放在船上，再去喝咖啡。）。他们从浓缩的炼乳罐头里取出咖啡，那是从早晨服务渔夫的地方拿来的（张：他们到一个大清早做渔夫们生意的地方，用听头炼乳的洋铁罐喝咖啡。），你怎么总能睡得这么早，老头子？（张：「老头子你睡得怎么样？」）男孩问，虽然他已经起来了，但是依然觉得早起他对来说很困难。很好，玛洛琳，老人说，我今天很有自信。我也是，男孩说，现在我要去取你和我的沙丁鱼了，还有你的鱼饵。老人自己把渔具带来了，他从没想过要任何人帮忙（张：「现在我得去拿你同我的沙汀鱼，还有你的新鲜的饵。我们的工具他自己带来。他从来不要别人帮着拿什么。」）。

**【反馈】**
1.They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen.这句话没翻译正确，主要是把had理解错了。
2.
**【难点】**「现在我得去拿你同我的沙汀鱼，还有你的新鲜的饵。我们的工具他自己带来。他从来不要别人帮着拿什么。」这里的他是谁？

"We're different," the old man said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old." "I know it," the boy said. "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here." He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.

我们不一样（张：是两样的），老人说，你（才）五岁的时候，我就让你帮我拿东西了，我知道，男孩说。我马上回来，带点咖啡（张：再喝点咖啡），我们在这儿还是有点信用的（张：我们在这里可以赊赈的。），他走开了，光秃秃的脚踩在珊瑚礁上（赤着脚踏在珊瑚石上），朝着冰屋的方向走去，那里放着鱼饵（张：走到冰房里去，饵贮藏在那里。）。老人慢慢地喝着咖啡，他这一天就吃这点东西了。老人知道自己应该吃掉它，在很长一段时间里，吃饭困扰着老人，他从不带午饭，但他的船头总有一瓶水，他知道那是他一整天需要的（张：老人慢慢地喝他的咖啡。他一天就吃这么点东西，他知道他应当吃掉它。他久已对吃喝感到厌倦了，现在他出去从来不带午饭。他有一瓶水放在船头上，除此以外他这一整天什么都不需要了。）。

**【反馈】**
1.光秃秃=赤，踩=踏
2.“他久已对吃喝感到厌倦了”简单清晰，我的过于冗余
3.“除此以外他这一整天什么都不需要了。”直接翻译过于别扭的话，可以试试反着翻译。

The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water. "Good luck old man." "Good luck," the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbor in the dark.

男孩现在（张：这时）带着沙丁鱼和两条鱼饵（张：报纸包着的两饵回来）回来了，鱼饵用报纸包着。他们沿着小径走向小船。。。。。。。（张：他们沿着路下去，向小船走去，他们可以觉得脚下底踏着沙，沙里嵌着石子，），祝你好运，老人说，他把桨上的绳索绑在（thole pins）桨架上，他身子向前一仰，把桨叶插到水里一划拉，就在夜色中驶出了海湾（张：把他桨上缚着的绳子套在船边的桨架上；桨在水里一戳，他的身子就向前一冲，他开始划到海港外面去了，在黑暗中。）

**【反馈】**

1.单一变量的时候可以拆分更加清晰，两个的话可以直接在要描写的主体上加上定语。“报纸包着的两饵回来”
2.“把他桨上缚着的绳子套在船边的桨架上；桨在水里一戳，他的身子就向前一冲，他开始划到海港外面去了，在黑暗中。”张特别喜欢把在黑暗中提出来单独放一小句，

There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills. Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbor and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.

还有一些其他的船只从岸上出发，老人看不见他们，但老人能听到他们的桨叶撞击水花的声音，现在月亮渐渐跑到山下去了. 有时候一些人会在船上说话，但是多数船都很沉默，只有木浆打起水花的声音，他们一出海湾口就散开了，每个人都向着自己认为能找到鱼群的方向驶去。老人知道自己要去更远的地方，他把陆地的气息远远的甩在后面，把小船驶入清晨的海洋气息之中。

**【反馈】**
He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the flour of the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and baitfish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.
老人划了一会儿之后，他看见墨西哥湾海草在水中闪烁的粼光，这里的渔夫称这个地方为大井，因为这个地方突然深至七百寻，由于洋流撞在陡峭的悬崖上形成了漩涡，各种鱼类都在这里聚集。有虾米和饵料鱼，海洋最深处的洞里还有成群结队的乌贼，到了晚上，他们升上来，就被游过的鱼类吃掉了。

In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones.
在黑暗中，老人能感觉到快要日出了，他划船的时候听到飞鱼离开水面翅膀震动的声音，在黑暗中，飞鱼僵硬的翅膀在飞翔时发出嘶嘶声。老人喜欢飞鱼，他们是他在大海上唯一的朋友，他为那些鸟感到悲哀，尤其是那些娇小的，黝黑的海燕。他们总是飞来飞去地找食，但没有几次找到过食物，老人想，这些鸟儿可比我们悲惨多了，除了贼鸥和那些强壮的鸟

Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea. He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say had things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman.
为什么他们把鸟造的像海燕一样又温和又娇小呢？尤其是大海还这么残酷的时候？她那么和蔼而美丽。但他也有残忍的时候，那个时候来的太突然了。那些鸟飞着，俯冲下来捕食猎物，他们那小且悲伤的嗓子对大海来说太微不足道了。他总把大海想成拉姆，那是当西班牙人爱他时给他起的名字。有时候这些爱他的人会谈论它，他们把他当作女人来谈论。



Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favors, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.
一些年轻的渔夫会用浮标做掉丝的浮子，他们还有摩托艇。那是他们用卖掉的鲨鱼内脏换来的，他们称他为男性的艾玛。他们把大海看作是竞争者，一处领地甚至是敌人。可是老人总是把他看作是一位女性，总是给予或者保留着巨大的恩惠。即便它做了一些狂野乃至奇怪的事情，也是因为他不能帮助他们，这轮月亮影响了他作为一位女性。老人想

He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current. He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour. I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I'll work out where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them. Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current.
他把船划的很稳健，自从他稳定了速度之后，这对老人来说轻而易举，况且海面风平浪静，除了洋流偶尔会形成一些小漩涡。他让洋流替他做了一部分工作，天空开始出现光亮的时候，他发现自己远比预期划的远，我在大井打了好几天鱼，一条鱼也没有找到，他想，今天我会找到鲣鱼和金枪鱼群的，可能还会有一条大鱼跟着他们。在天空完全变亮以前，他会把鱼饵抛下去，让它顺着洋流漂流。



One bait was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both  eyes so that they made` a half-gar-land` on the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could fell which was not sweet smelling and good tasting.
一个鱼饵放在四十寻深的地方，第二个鱼饵在七十五寻深的地方，第三和第四个鱼饵则放在离蓝色的水面225寻深的地方。每条鱼饵的吊钩都向下垂着，钩脚都藏在做饵的鱼的体内。从钩子弯曲的地方到钩尖，每一部分都紧紧被沙丁鱼紧紧地覆盖。每条沙丁鱼都用钩子穿过两只眼睛，他们做了在钩子上做了一个........钩子上的每个角落无不让大鱼觉得香气扑鼻，垂涎三尺。

## [](https://github.com/Louie5/TranslatingForWriting/blob/master/ch2/1-source-text.md#part-10)Part 10

The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, `or albacores`, which hung on the two deepest lines like `plummets` and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness.
男孩给过他两条新鲜的小金枪鱼，or albacores，绑在两条最深的钩子上，在其他的钩子上，他绑上了一条大蓝色的三文鱼和一条黄色的鲹，都是之前用过的, 但是他们依然新鲜，况且还有两条极好的沙丁鱼让他们变得香气四溢，吸引大鱼。

Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line. Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise. The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current.
每条线都有铅笔那样粗，它们环绕在一根绿色的棒子上，任何轻微的拉扯或是触碰都会让棒子移动。每根鱼线都配备有两个四十英寸长的线圈，能够更快地利用闲置的鱼线，如果必要的话，一只鱼能用300寻的线来对付。现在老人看着钓竿和水面接触的地方，那钓竿靠在小船的边上。老人轻轻划着船，小心地保持鱼线垂直着水面，并在合适的地方上下移动。天已经很亮了，太阳可能在任何时候升起，太阳渐渐的从海面上升起，现在老人可以看见其他的船了，他们在水面低低的地方，向着海岸走去，分散在洋流中。
Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it `hurt sharply` and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting `exactly` ` where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there`. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred. But, he thought, I keep them with precision.
太阳越来越明亮，阳光从水中反射开来，当太阳完全升起来时，平坦的海面把阳光送入老人的眼睛，这让老人非常痛苦，他只好一边划船一边躲避这些光线。他向水中看去，那根鱼线直直地垂在幽暗的水中，在让鱼线保持垂直这件事上他比任何渔夫都要较真，黑暗的水流中每一层都有一颗鱼饵在守候，这是老人为那些游过的鱼准备的。其他渔夫让鱼线随着海流漂着，那些渔夫想让鱼线在100寻的时候，鱼线其实在60寻，但是，老人想，我把它们放置的很好。


Only I have no luck any more. But who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. `It is better to be lucky`. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready. The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore. All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I can look straight into it `without getting the blackness`. It has more force in the evening too. But in the morning it is painful.
可能我已经没有运气了，谁知道呢？可能运气在今天就会来，每天都是崭新的，这对运气来说再好不过了，可我宁愿准确点，这样运气来的时候我就已经准备好了。太阳已经升起来两个像小时了，老人向东看时水面上的反光也不再那么刺眼了。他的视野里能看见三条船，它们离海岸很近，看起来低低的。在我一生中，早上的太阳总是刺伤我的眼睛，他想。不过他们看的依然清楚。在晚上我也能看得清楚。或许他们在晚上更好用，早上眼睛总是疼。

Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again. "He's got something," the old man said aloud. "He's not just looking." He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down. `But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.`
她看见有着长且黑的翅膀的军舰鸟在他的头上盘旋，他把翅膀朝后合拢，斜着一头扎进水里。过了一会儿，他又在老人头顶盘旋了。“他抓到什么东西了。”老人大声的说。“它不仅仅在看”他慢慢地平稳划向那只鸟盘旋的地方。他并不着急，依然让鱼线保持起落。但是他挤进洋流了一点以至于他依然准确的捕鱼，即使比他以往的...........
The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. `Then be dove` suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface. "Dolphin," the old man said aloud. "Big dolphin." `He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines.` He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow.
这只鸟在更高的地方又开始盘旋了，它的翅膀丝毫没有摆动。......................老人看见飞鱼从海面飞射出来，拼命在水面上航行。“海豚”老人大声说。“大海豚”，他运起浆。。。。。。.。。他。。。。。。
He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water. As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish. The dolphins were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and `would be in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped.`
他又去划船了，看着在天空中工作的长翅黑鸟。现在，低低地在水面上方。他看见这只鸟又俯冲下来，倾斜着潜到水中去了，当他追逐飞鱼的时候，他疯狂却徒劳地摇摆着。老人可以看见水面轻微的隆起，那是大海豚跟随逃窜的鱼类上来的。大海豚切入了飞鱼下方的水流................

It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast. He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them. My big fish must be somewhere.
这是一个巨大的海豚群，他想，飞鱼的机会不多了，他们无处不在。这只鸟没有多少机会，飞鱼对他来说太大了，而且他们的速读太快了。他一次次看见飞鱼跃出水面和鸟那没有多少用处的动作。这些海豚要离我远去了，他想，他们游得太快，也太远了。但是也许我会选择一条不同的路，或许我的大鱼就在他们旁边，我的大鱼一定在什么地方。

The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish.
天上的云覆盖着大地，像山一样升起。海岸已经是一条长长的绿线了，灰蓝的山丘在绿线后面。水面现在看起来是深蓝色的，蓝色那么深，看起来像是紫色了。老人向水里看去，他看见幽暗的水里有一些长着红色滤网的浮游生物，在太阳的照射下发出奇特的光芒。他顺着鱼线直直地看下去，在水里看不见尽头。他很高兴能看见这么多浮游生物，这意味着鱼也在这里。

The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. `But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man of war floating close beside the boat. `It turned on its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.
太阳在水中发出奇异的光线，太阳越来越高，这意味着好天气。这片土地上云的形状也是如此。但是现在看不见鸟了，水面上什么也没有。......................他打开他的侧面，然后修正自己，
